Richard Van is a well-rounded individual with experience in attempting his own startup, traveling the world, and working as a developer for five years.  He enjoys leveraging technology to do new things.

In his early life, he was born in Reno, Nevada where he attended public school for K-12 education.

He received a B.S. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/) in 2010, from the University of California, Los Angeles; and a Master's of [Business Administration ](http://www.unr.edu/degrees/business-administration/mba) in 2013, from the University of Nevada, Reno.

He was formerly a software engineer at [International Game Technology](https://www.igt.com/) with five years of work experience,  full-time (June 2010 to May 2014), and two internships (Summer 2008 and Summer 2009) where he worked on in-house casino software and mobile apps.

In 2014 he gracefully quit his job and did some long-term traveling to learn more about the world and himself, he traveled through over twenty [countries](http://richardvan.com/pages/travel.html) for six months.

In 2015 he and his friend bootstrapped their own startup idea that focused on Nightlife Events Planning called [SinPal](http://richardvan.com/pages/startup.html). The idea didn't gain the traction they aimed for but they both learned a lot from the experience.

Outside of his professional career, he also has work experience in both customer service  and construction projects.

Leisurely he enjoys reading, exercising, cooking, walking his dog, watching sports, snowboarding/skiing, scuba diving, tinkering with the [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and listening to music.
