### 4/9/2016

Today I woke up, let the dogs out, fed them, and fed myself with a good yogurt exilir.  I also made sure I got in my pushups and then I read two blinks instead of watching Election 2.  It took willpower to shift away from Election 2 since I had just seen Y&D series last weekend and Election 1 last night.

I was able to get access to my old files from buying a SATA to USB adapter on Amazon that worked to allow me to read my old internal HDDs.  I have been transfering them into google drive and eventually plan to organize all my photos.

Within my old files I have been able to access my travel photos from phase 1 along with my old college projects which I have been looking for to upload to my person website.

I was able to get Jekyll to compile locally on my computer yesterday which I am pretty happy about.

Took Lucky on a walk before the rain/sunshine sporadically came and went. Made Longanisa, Eggs, and heated some on-choy for lunch with rice.  

Read up on beards and am considering a year length no haircut so I can tie it up one day for that look. Watched Election II. Did more research on famous people for my blog.  Researched my Chinese name.

### 4/10/2016
This morning woke up around 9 and did the usual routine including reading a quick blink on how champions think optimistically each day and work towards their goals.

Went to Walmart and KTP after to pick up morning yogurt elixir stuff and KTP to get some marinated pork, and kimchi that was $1 a pound but huge napa cuts.

Took Lucky on a walk around the neighborhood and let him go all and he was so happy. Now he lifts his foot up to pee and also he barks when he is maximum level of excitement.

Woke up early and fed the dogs then drove with Lucky to JG house where she, Desi, and I went to Red Rock Canyon together.  Had a good walk at Pine Creek Trail, Lucky was doing really well and it was a good day.  After that we home and prepared for JG BBQ for her bday. Jino, Mark, Sinead, Eric, Desi, Felipe, and Channing were there.  It was good cooking charcoal chicken and tri tip for them.  We ate, chilled, blazed, and then everyone went home.  Found out Sheryl had moved out that day, Mark staying until end of the month, Jino and Tara going to move all at once.

Started reading into Javascript design patterns.  Learned about the Singleton pattern which follows that there can only be one instance of a class at any given time.  Example is useful for something like a network connection provider class.

Brought Lucky in for his appointment in the morning and it went well.  His 8-10 sutures were removed and Dr. Lavengco said that he has made a full recovery.  There isn't study to support the long-term effects of increased pressure on the rest of his organs.

Watching the final game of Kobe Bryant, it's pretty amazing to see the support and level of dedication from current and past players.  They even named a metro stop after him two stops away from the Staple Center.  This is the final game of his 20 year career, it's amazing because he has done it that great for that long.

Did my usual morning routine with the addition of swimming in the pool for around 15 minutes as well.  Today I also went to a Startup Grind event with Jino at The Iron Yard.

Drove to JGs with Lucky and did Red Rock hike, then Mom and Dad came into town and then we ate at PhoSo1 then got Bambu.  Then we went to Costco and bought a lot of backyard furniture.  Had a BBQ with lambchops where it was JG, Mom, Dad, Eric and myself. The first thing both parents said to me was that I looked skinnier than last time they saw me.  I got in a good workout at 1030pm after helping mom and dad set up the TV and cable in their room.  Going to LA tomorrow for Coachella, but focused pretty much at home.

Writing this after Coachella which as I am reflecting on it on as fresh and straight out of my mind without interruption and listening to Chvrches which was one of the sets I saw at Coachella.  I test drove two Teslas, two Audis, through a whole bunch of trees.  The highlight of the weekend was definitely when a young teen college aged brunette white girl from UCSB asked me to carry her on my shoulders to Calvin Harris.  I carried her four a good three songs before smoking with her and some of her friends.  Her name was Gabby, I also talked to another Caucasian girl named Alice on the second night during my roll at the Chainsmokers set, and the day after I got back from LA at the local home depot with a heavenly looking dirty blonde girl who I made small talk with.

Reflecting on it this weekend I have a deeper understanding of friendship/brotherhood within the vigilante group. Had a couple deep talks with Aaron, Steven, and Kent. Talking to them about my life situation with regards to my career, love life, work, home, dogs, and well-being helped me better understand myself.

The lesson is the have things to look forward to and to put in place things that will only generate more better things to look forward to.  So it's a cycle which you follow and get through life with which will hopefully take you on a path that I would enjoy looking back on at some point in my life that I went that way.

I am strongly considering taking summer school classes so I can get myself back into a routine and also just expand my mind in a completely different direction.  At the minute I am strongly considering taking the Helsinki Bus Theory into account and get back onto the tech bus.  But, without knowing what I can offer to the world of medicine (animal medicine), then I would not know.

Since the last update I have spoken to Mom, Dad, Chi, and Bang about my decision to go back to school to take more biology and chemistry classes.  The plan would be to obtain either another Bachelor's, Post Bacc, or satisfy the required classes for my application to Veterinary school.  At this point I am will to pay for my classes and everything else using my savings and dipping into my Roth IRA.  If I am blessed to be given the opportunity to attend a school, then I will consult the parents for tuitions or consider a federal loan.

I have felt a lot more confident about my body and self image since I have been getting pretty good compliments with regards to my weight not only from Mom and Dad but also Mark, Jino, and Tara as well.  Also as I experiement with the early stages of a hairstyle for the Man Bun with a beard, things seem to be going pretty well.  I have been making myself wake up earlier and earlier.  I plan to try and get the most out of my day before it hits 8AM or even 11AM, likely times for when class starts.
