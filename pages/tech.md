This is a list of software, websites, and tools I commonly find myself using. Technological shifts come into when I thought of maintaining this page. I constantly interacted with technology growing up and even today.  I wanted to see how things have changed over the years. The key difference between my adolescence and adulthood is the speed at which information is shared (i.e. the speed and availability of the internet).

Hopefully you'll find a useful tool here or something new to try out. This is not an exhaustive list.

### Software

Current technology I use on a regular basis

#### <a name="current"></a>[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) [100GB/mo for $2]

There are many cloud storage solutions out there but I like Google Drive because of it's pricing coupled with its external developer APIs. It's $2/month to store 100GB of data in the cloud; or free for an account up to 15GB. I remember when I was once conned into buying a 32MB Compact Flash card for $100 at one of those privately owned camera stores a block away from Wall St. back in 2001. 100GB is plenty of data and sticking to a hard limit forces me to organize and distill what new files are saved.  

#### <a name="current"></a>[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)

I started using this in 2008 as it was one of the more popular cloud file store that also had a nice intuitive UI.  I current dedicate dropbox as the first place my photos (taken on my phone) are backed up to.  This is done automatically in the background.  It's very convenient just be able to just log into dropbox and view your images on a browser instead of your small phone screen.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Evernote](https://evernote.com) [Plus Membership, $24.99/yr]

I started using this in 2015 and it's been awesome able to archive stuff I've read online using the [Evernote Web Clipper for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc?hl=en) which is a must in my opinion.  I also dedicate most of my non-code text based files here because of it's notebook structure, elegant UI, and organized feel.


#### <a name="current"></a>[Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com) 

Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are productivity tools for the computer, I have used multiple iterations of this product since I got my first computer in middle school. The industry standard format of information for a majority of email content sent to other people.

#### <a name="current"></a>[TurboTax](https://turbotax.com/) 

It's easy to file your own taxes, this product has served my well since 2011 with an intuitive interface and different tiers of offerings depending on your income/portfolio.

### Developer Programs and Tools 

These are developer tools that I find add a lot of value to how I set up my work environment


#### <a name="current"></a>[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) 

An open-source file editor developed by Adobe. I started using this in 2014 as my default editor.  It's lightweight and has a good feel while being support other extensions as well, below are the onces I like and would recommend

- [Brackets Icons](https://github.com/ivogabe/Brackets-Icons)
- [Brackets Tabs](https://github.com/crot4lus/Brackets---Tabs)

#### <a name="current"></a>[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) 

Highly recommended package manager for OSX, beyond your typical shell (in the form of **Terminal** on the Mac) commands such as **ls**,**mkdir**,**cd**,**pwd**,**mv**,**rm**, you might want helpful commands like **wget**, TODO_more, 

#### <a name="current"></a>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 

Described as a Static Page Generator, this website is built from Jekyll.  Due to it's usefulness, I find myself immersed in technology more than ever before since I am writing about it now in the form of this blog.

### Programming Languages

I have learned many programming languages to varying degrees over my lifetime. What you come to learn is that there are similiar core features such as (int,double,bool,arrays) you can expect to find in most widely used modern languages at all levels of the stack.  However, the semantics of how things work is entirely different.  While I don't claim to be an expert in any of these programming languages, I have had experience with them.  Some more than others.


[Turbo C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C) - My first exposure to programming was during a computer class in summer school during high school.  We experimented around with coding using if-else statements to take in some basic input and do arithmetic on it.  This was the starting point of my interest in code.

### Video Games (chronologically):

I have probably played well over 100 of video games on systems like the NES, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Playstation, N64, Playstation 2, Xbox, Playstation 3, and the PC. The stories in those games and mechanics of how things work help raised my mindset since I was in gradeschool to some degree.  I have different priorities nowadays versus back then which has led me to devote a lot less time to video games.  In retrospect, here are some of my favorite video games that made the cut in my world.
