This is a list of software, websites, and tools I commonly find myself using. Technological shifts come into when I thought of maintaining this page. I constantly interacted with technology growing up and even today.  I wanted to see how things have changed over the years. The key difference between my adolescence and adulthood is the speed at which information is shared (i.e. the speed and availability of the internet).

Hopefully you'll find a useful tool here or something new to try out.

### Software and Web Applications

Current technology I use on a regular basis

#### <a name="current"></a>[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

There are many cloud storage solutions out there but I like Google Drive because of it's pricing coupled with its external developer APIs. It's $2/month to store 100GB of data in the cloud; or free for an account up to 15GB. I remember when I was once conned into buying a 32MB Compact Flash card for $100 at one of those privately owned camera stores a block away from Wall St. back in 2001. 100GB is plenty of data and sticking to a hard limit forces me to organize and distill what new files are saved.  

#### <a name="current"></a>[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)

I started using this in 2008 as it was one of the more popular cloud file store that also had a nice intuitive UI.  I current dedicate dropbox as the first place my photos (taken on my phone) are backed up to.  This is done automatically in the background.  It's very convenient just be able to just log into dropbox and view your images on a browser instead of your small phone screen.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Evernote](https://evernote.com) 

I started using this in 2015 and it's been awesome able to archive stuff I've read online using the [Evernote Web Clipper for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc?hl=en) which is a must in my opinion.  I also dedicate most of my non-code text based files here because of it's notebook structure, elegant UI, and organized feel.

Online forum for discussion of almost anything

#### <a name="current"></a>[Quora](https://www.quora.com/)

### Developer Programs and Tools 

These are developer tools that I find add a lot of value to my work flow.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Git/Github](https://github.com/)

Git is a distributed version-control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git the tool, GitHub the service for projects that use Git.

Cloud platform that allows for rapid development of web applications.  Handy and easy to get started with to get project ideas into a live web environment.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) 

Highly recommended package manager for OSX, beyond your typical shell (in the form of **Terminal** on the Mac) commands such as **ls**,**mkdir**,**cd**,**pwd**,**mv**,**rm**, you might want helpful commands like **wget**, TODO_more, 

#### <a name="current"></a>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

The command line interface tool found in the [MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (that allows a programmer to control [UNIX](http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix.html) operations.  Working with the command line allows a developer to have more control of the operating system they are working on.  This was difficult to set up in Windows which is probably  one of the less-known reasons why they lost so many users in the past decade.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com) 

Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are productivity tools for the computer, I have used multiple iterations of this product since I got my first computer in middle school. The industry standard format of information for a majority of email content sent to other people.

### Programming Languages

I have learned many programming languages, frameworks, and operating systems to varying degrees over my lifetime. What you come to learn is that there are similiar core features such as (int,double,bool,arrays) you can expect to find in most widely used modern languages at all levels of the stack.  However, the semantics of how things work is entirely different.  While I don't claim to be an expert in any of these programming languages, I have had experience with them.  Some more than others.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Node Framework](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

Javascript ecosystem that has allowed for full stack development. Probably the most useful feature is the NPM ([node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)) which comes with many community supported libraries with useful functionality support the "don't re-invent the wheel" philosophy

### Video Games

I have probably played well over 100 of video games on systems like the NES, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Playstation, N64, Playstation 2, Xbox, Playstation 3, and the PC. The stories in those games and mechanics of how things work help raised my mindset since I was in gradeschool to some degree.  I have different priorities nowadays versus back then which has led me to devote a lot less time to video games.  In retrospect, here are some of my favorite video games that made the cut as impactful enough to mention.
